# bellabeat_case_study

## Welcome
This case study of Bellabeat is my capstone project completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate. Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products focusing on women.

The aim of the project was to generate data-driven recommendations regarding the marketing strategy for Bellabeat, focusing on one of Bellabeatâ€™s products: the Bellabeat app. The recommendations in this report will be built upon observations from analysing smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices.

The report follows the six steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
